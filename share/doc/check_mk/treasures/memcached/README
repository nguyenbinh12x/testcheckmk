This is a check to monitor the linux memcache daemon, including agent plugin,
configurable levels and custom metrics.
All metrics are reported in a single service and several of the monitored
metrics are raw totals, such was the customers wish.
Hence, in its current form, this check doesn't fit into the regular check_mk
distribution.
